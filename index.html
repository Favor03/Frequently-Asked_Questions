    <h1>50 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Life Insurance.</h1>
    <ol>
        <h1><li>Do I need life insurance?</li></h1>
        <p>Not necessarily. If you have no children or dependents whom you support financially,
             you might not need a life insurance policy after all. Life insurance aims to provide
              a solution for those who seek income replacement, mortgage protection, estate planning, 
              leaving a legacy, or burial expenses.  However, if someone you love is dependent on you 
              financially, you need life insurance.</p>

        <h1><li>How can I save money when buying life insurance?</li></h1>
        <p>Buying a term life or a combination of term and permanent insurance may help you pay a lower premium. 
            Buying a policy early in life is also a good way to ensure a lower premium. The older you are, the higher
             the premiums, and the more risk you have of developing a health condition that could increase your premium 
             even more or disqualify you from getting coverage at all. You can read more about saving on life insurance here.</p>

        <h1><li>How does the insurance company determine my premium?</li></h1>
        <p>Premium rates are typically based on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, health status (including whether or 
        not you use tobacco), and if you participate in high-risk activities or occupations.</p>

        <h1><li> What is a permanent policy?</li></h1>
        <p>Permanent policies are typically the best option if you are looking for life-long protection, or an option to accumulate
         a tax-deferred cash value. A portion of the premium of a permanent policy is used to build up a cash value. The cash value can 
         be used in several different ways, including allowing you to take out a loan against the cash value, or paying your premium after 
         your policy is fully paid up.</p>


         <h1><li> Once I buy the policy, will I even need to change my insurance coverage?</li></h1>
        <p>If you already have a policy, it will usually have a lower premium rate than a new policy you would buy. If you’re buying a 
        permanent policy, the cash value will also be smaller for several years. Keeping all these factors in mind, it might be worth 
        considering a new policy if you have any significant changes in your life circumstances, such as if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are recently married or divorced</li>
            <li>Have or adopt a child (or became a grandparent)</li>
            <li>Have children or grandchildren who are about to enter college</li>
            <li>Provide care or financial help to a child or elderly parent</li>
            <li>Receive an inheritance</li>
            <li>Change or lose your job or salary</li>
        </ul>

        <h1><li>What happens if I miss a premium payment?</li></h1>
        <p>Most policies have a 31-day grace period wherein you can pay the premium 
        with no penalty or interest. If you have a term policy and do not make the payment within this grace period, the insurance 
        company will usually terminate the policy. If you have a permanent policy, you can authorize the insurance company to draw your 
        premium from your policy’s cash value.</p>
