            <p>Not necessarily. If you have no children or dependents whom you support financially, you might not need a life insurance policy after all. 
                Life insurance aims to provide a solution for those who seek income replacement, mortgage protection, estate planning, leaving a legacy, 
                or burial expenses. However, if someone you love is dependent on you financially, you need life insurance.</p>

            How can I save money when buying life insurance?

        <div class="pannel">
            <p>Buying a term life or a combination of term and permanent insurance may help you pay a lower premium. Buying a policy early in life is also a good way to ensure a lower premium. 
                The older you are, the higher the premiums, and the more risk you have of developing a health condition that could increase your premium even more or disqualify you from getting coverage at all.

    <div class="FAQs">
        <button class="accordion">
            What is a permanent policy?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
            <p>Permanent policies are typically the best option if you are looking for life-long protection, or an option to accumulate a tax-deferred cash value.
                 A portion of the premium of a permanent policy is used to build up a cash value. The cash value can be used in several different ways, including allowing
                  you to take out a loan against the cash value, or paying your premium after your policy is fully paid up.</p>
